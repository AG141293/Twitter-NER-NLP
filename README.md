# Twitter-NER-NLP
The goal is to automatically tag and analyze tweets for entities like people, companies, locations, and more, without relying on hashtags. Named Entity Recognition (NER) will identify and classify these entities. This project could enhance social media analysis, targeted marketing, and trend tracking.
